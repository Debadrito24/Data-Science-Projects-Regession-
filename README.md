## Title- Predicting Demand for a Bicycle Sharing Company. (CRISP-DM)

# <u>Predicting Demand for a  Bicycle Sharing Company.</u>

#  | CRISP-DM |


# <u>Introduction</u>:
    
Bicycle Sharing Systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership,
rental,and bike return is automated via a network of bike-stations located throughout a city. 
The  users of bike sharing systems can pick up bicycles from a bike-station in one location and return them to another in possibly any location of the city.Bike Sharing System ensures that pollution is reduced with use of bicycles there is reduction in use of motor vehicles which leads to reduction in emission of pollutants in the air. 

# <u>Project-Description</u>:

This project work, focuses on which algorithm can work better for the real world problem of
bicycle sharing demand prediction and there after recommending which are the important factors for predicting the demand.


# <u>Problem-Statement</u>:

   In a bicycle sharing systems it is very important for
   the administrators to know how many cycles will be
   needed in each bicycle station, knowing this count, it enables
   them to arrange proper number of cycles at the stations and
   decide whether a particular station needs to have extra number of bicycle at that stands.
   Utilizing a seperate weather data and not the usage pattern here, its needed to forecast bike rental demand in the    Capital          Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.
   
# <u>Business Goal</u>:

To predict the demand of the bicycles for rent on a given day on the basis of the  data set provided so that utilization of the cycles are maximum there by resulting in maximising the revenue.Also Identifying the major features for predicting.
   
   
# <u>Data-Source</u>:

The dataset in this project is provided by Kaggle and is an open dataset hosted at UCI Machine Learning Repository
"<b> Bike Sharing Data Set</b>"

# <u>Data</u>:

#### <u>Independent Variables</u>:

<br/><b>datetime</b> - hourly date + timestamp (2011-12) <br>
<b>season</b> -  1 = spring, 2 = summer, 3 = fall, 4 = winter <br>
<b>holiday</b> - whether the day is considered a holiday <br>
<b>workingday</b> - whether the day is neither a weekend nor holiday
<br/>
<b>weather</b> -<br/> 1: Clear, Few clouds, Partly cloudy, Partly cloudy   
          2: Mist + Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds, Mist   
          3: Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds  
          4: Heavy Rain + Ice Pallets + Thunderstorm + Mist, Snow + Fog <br/>
<br/>
<b>temp</b> - temperature in Celsius  <br>
<b>atemp</b> - "feels like" temperature in Celsius  <br>
<b>humidity</b> - relative humidity  <br>
<b>windspeed</b> - wind speed   <br>
<b>casual</b> - number of non-registered user rentals initiated   <br>
<b>registered</b> - number of registered user rentals initiated   <br>

#### <u>Dependent Variable</u>:
<b>count</b> - number of total rentals   <br/>
